; rom/main.asm — 2068-Forth Milestone 0 boot stub
;
; Inherited verbatim from the 2068-Leap project's own Milestone 0 (same
; author, MIT-licensed, separate repo — see docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md for the
; full provenance and divergence plan). Purpose: prove the ORG $0000
; layout, RST vector table, and stack init are correct on real/emulated
; TS2068 hardware, BEFORE any Forth-specific code exists. Deliberately
; does not depend on screen text output or fonts — neither is wired up
; yet — so the only thing this can fail on is the boot chain itself, not
; something built later.
;
; Smoke test: the border colour cycles through all 8 values in a loop. If
; you see that in Fuse (or on real hardware), the vector table and stack
; init below are sound and it's safe to build kernel/io text output on top
; of this file. If you see nothing (blank/frozen screen), the bug is here,
; not in something more complex layered on top later.
;
; NOT YET FULLY VERIFIED ON REAL HARDWARE OR IN AN EMULATOR — assembles
; cleanly under sjasmplus 1.23.1 as of the DEVICE fix below, but hasn't
; been run in Fuse yet. Treat the border-cycle behaviour as reviewed-by-
; eye only until confirmed.
;
; Build:
;   sjasmplus rom/main.asm
;   (produces rom0.bin per the SAVEBIN line at the end of this file)
;
; Run:
;   fuse --machine ts2068 --rom-ts2068-0 rom0.bin --rom-ts2068-1 <placeholder>
;   (rom0.bin is 16K — Fuse itself confirmed this; see docs/memory_map.md.
;   ROM1 doesn't matter yet — kernel/sound and the extended kernel routines
;   that will eventually live there don't exist. Any 8K placeholder file
;   is fine for --rom-ts2068-1 for now, though its exact required size
;   hasn't been confirmed against Fuse the way ROM0's has.)
