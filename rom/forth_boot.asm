; rom/forth_boot.asm — the first real, live, bootable 2068-Forth ROM
;
; Distinct from every rom/forth_smoke_p*.asm file in this project: those
; are automated regression tests with no keyboard input and a
; border-color pass/fail signal; this is the actual product — it boots,
; prints a banner, plays the startup sound tracked as an open product
; requirement since Phase 4 (docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md, "Product requirement
; — startup screen plays a startup sound"), and hands control to
; core/editor.asm's EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE for real, live, interactive use —
; the same live interpreter loop Phase 6 built but could not safely
; call, because kernel/io's IO_READ_KEY only consumes a key already
; latched by a real IM 1 interrupt, and no ROM before this one ever
; turned interrupts on. See rom/forth_smoke_p9.asm's own header for the
; full story of what had to be fixed first (a dictionary-chain
; structural bug spanning core/control.asm, core/storage.asm, and
; core/float.asm) and how the real interrupt wiring below was confirmed
; against 2068-Leap's own working ROM files, not guessed.
;
; The full dictionary is assembled here: every word from every phase
; (0=/IF/ELSE/THEN/BEGIN/UNTIL, PLOT/LINE/CIRCLE/BEEP/BORDER,
; SAVE/LOAD, F+/F-, 64COL/32COL/PALETTE64/PLOT64, EMIT/., =/</>,
; VARIABLE/CONSTANT), chained into one LATEST list via the same
; DICT_CHAIN_POINT splices rom/forth_smoke_p9.asm introduced and
; proved.
;
; WHAT ISN'T HERE YET, stated plainly: no live automated test exercises
; the interactive loop this file actually boots into — by its nature,
; that needs a real or simulated keyboard, not a fixed source string.
; Manual confirmation in Fuse (or real hardware) with an actual keyboard
; remains the honest gap, exactly as core/editor.asm's own header
; already says for EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE. The startup sound is BEEP's own
; existing raw hardware-timing units (kernel/sound's SOUND_BEEP), not a
; considered musical choice — a real, open follow-up, not hidden.

; INTERPRET_UNKNOWN_WORD — core/interp.asm's hook for a token that's
; neither a known word nor a valid number. Every rom/forth_smoke_p*.asm
; file hangs here on purpose (a bug in fixed, hand-written test source
; should stop hard and loud). That's the wrong choice for a live,
; interactive system: a real typo would otherwise need a hardware
; reset to recover from. INTERPRET_RUN reaches this hook via a bare
; `jp`, not `call`, so the Z80 return-address stack at this point still
; holds exactly one entry — INTERPRET_RUN's own caller
; (EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE's `call INTERPRET_RUN`). A bare `ret` here abandons
; the rest of the current line and returns straight to
; EDITOR_LOOP_LIVE, which starts a fresh prompt — real, if minimal,
; error recovery, not a hang. No error message is shown yet — EMIT/.
; exist now (core/print.asm) so the print path this comment used to say
; was missing is no longer the blocker, but wiring an actual "?" or
; error text into this hook is still real, open follow-up work, not
; done here: a genuine typo currently looks identical to a typo that
; happened to be typed slightly differently and got silently discarded,
; since there is no error indicator of any kind yet.
